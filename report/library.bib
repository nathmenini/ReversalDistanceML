abstract = {Multiple nucleic acid or amino acid sequences alignment is one of the most commonly used techniques in bioinformatics. It helps find out homology between new sequences and existing ones. In this paper, we propose a new approach for multiple sequence alignment using genetic algorithms. The aligning order of the sequences is represented by a spanning tree, and the optimum (or very close to it) alignment is yielded by interchanging information between fitter spanning trees. The experimental results manifest that the performance of the proposed method is better than those of existing methods.},

@article{Thompson2005,
abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment is one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biology. It is used to identify conserved motifs, to determine protein domains, in 2D/3D structure prediction by homology and in evolutionary studies. Recently, high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and structural proteomics have lead to an explosion in the amount of sequence and structure information available. In response, several new multiple alignment methods have been developed that improve both the efficiency and the quality of protein alignments. Consequently, the benchmarks used to evaluate and compare these methods must also evolve. We present here the latest release of the most widely used multiple alignment benchmark, BAliBASE, which provides high quality, manually refined, reference alignments based on 3D structural superpositions. Version 3.0 of BAliBASE includes new, more challenging test cases, representing the real problems encountered when aligning large sets of complex sequences. Using a novel, semiautomatic update protocol, the number of protein families in the benchmark has been increased and representative test cases are now available that cover most of the protein fold space. The total number of proteins in BAliBASE has also been significantly increased from 1444 to 6255 sequences. In addition, full-length sequences are now provided for all test cases, which represent difficult cases for both global and local alignment programs. Finally, the BAliBASE Web site (http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/balibase) has been completely redesigned to provide a more user-friendly, interactive interface for the visualization of the BAliBASE reference alignments and the associated annotations.},

@article{Sun2012,
abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an NP-complete and important problem in bioinfor- matics. For MSA, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are known to be powerful tools. However, the training of HMMs is computationally hard so that metaheuristic methods such as simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been employed to tackle the training problem. In this paper, quantum- behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), a variant of PSO, is analyzed mathematically firstly, and then an improved version is proposed to train the HMMs for MSA. The proposed method, called diversity-maintained QPSO (DMQPO), is based on the analysis of QPSO and integrates a diversity control strategy into QPSO to enhance the global search ability of the particle swarm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we use DMQPSO, QPSO and other algorithms to train the HMMs for MSA on three benchmark datasets. The experiment results show that the HMMs trained with DMQPSO and QPSO yield better alignments for the benchmark datasets than other most commonly used HMM training methods such as Baum–Welch and PSO. ?},

@article{Rasmussen2003,
abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the basic problems in computational biology. Realistic problem instances of MSA are computationally intractable for exact algorithms. One way to tackle MSA is to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are known to be very powerful in the related problem domain of speech recognition. However, the training of HMMs is computationally hard and there is no known exact method that can guarantee optimal training within reasonable computing time. Perhaps the most powerful training method is the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is fast, but bears the problem of stagnation at local optima. In the study reported in this paper, we used a hybrid algorithm combining particle swarm optimization with evolutionary algorithms to train HMMs for the alignment of protein sequences. Our experiments show that our approach yields better alignments for a set of benchmark protein sequences than the most commonly applied HMM training methods, such as Baum-Welch and Simulated Annealing. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {MSA, that stands for Multiple Sequence Alignment, is one of the most important tools on bioinformatics and computational biology fields. Its usage includes phylogenetic trees creation, motifs and conservated domains prediction, as well as protein secondary and tertiary structure and function prediction. Genetic algorithms are heuristics for local search used on optimization problems, ins- pired on the natural selection concepts: a population of possible solution is created and iterativelly mate and selected in order to search for a suitable solution to the target problem. This dissertation describes the study we proceed on using genetic algorithms to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem. As results of this work, two tools were developed: ALGAe, a genetic algorithm exe- cution environment for MSA solving, and Anubis, a multiple sequence alignment viewer that allows comparing a given MSA against a benchmark, in order to find discrepancies among them.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach to multiple sequence alignment using genetic algorithms and an associated software package called SAGA. The method involves evolving a population of alignments in a quasi evolutionary manner and gradually improving the fitness of the population as measured by an objective function which measures multiple alignment quality. SAGA uses an automatic scheduling scheme to control the usage of 22 different operators for combining alignments or mutating them between generations. When used to optimise the well known sums of pairs objective function, SAGA performs better than some of the widely used alternative packages. This is seen with respect to the ability to achieve an optimal solution and with regard to the accuracy of alignment by comparison with reference alignments based on sequences of known tertiary structure. The general attraction of the approach is the ability to optimise any objective function that one can invent.},
