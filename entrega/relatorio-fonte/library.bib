abstract="Reversals, transpositions and transreversals are common events in genome rearrangement. The genome rearrangement sorting problem is to transform one genome into another using the minimum number of given rearrangement operations. An integer permutation is used to represent a genome in many cases. It can be divided into disjoint strips with each strip denoting a block of consecutive integers. A singleton is a strip of one integer. And the genome rearrangement problem turns into the problem of sorting a permutation into the identity permutation equivalently. Hannenhalli and Pevzner designed a polynomial time algorithm for the unsigned reversal sorting problem on those permutations with O(log n) singletons. In this paper, first we describe one case in which Hannenhalli and Pevzner's algorithm may fail and propose a corrected approach. In addition, we propose a (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm for sorting unsigned permutations with O(log n) singletons by reversals of weight 1 and transpositions/transreversals of weight 2.",

    abstract = { The paper advocates a more extensive use of additive trees in community ecology. When the distance/dissimilarity coefficient is selected carefully, these trees can illuminate structural aspects that are not obvious otherwise. In particular, starting from squared distances based on presence/absence data, the resulting trees approximate relationships in species richness, a feature not available through other graphical techniques. The construction of additive trees is illustrated by three actual examples, representing different circumstances in the analysis of grassland community data. }

Therefore, integration of diverse applications and data from geographically distributed computing resources will become a major issue. We will present the status of our efforts for the realization of an automated protein prediction pipeline as an example for a complex biological workflow scenario in a Grid environment based on Web services. This case study demonstrates the ability of an easy orchestration of complex biological workflows based on Web services as building blocks and Triana as workflow engine.",

abstract="Analysis of genomes evolving by inversions leads to a general combinatorial problem of Sorting by Reversals, MIN-SBR, the problem of sorting a permutation by a minimum number of reversals. Following a series of preliminary results, Hannenhalli and Pevzner developed the first exact polynomial time algorithm for the problem of sorting signed permutations by reversals, and a polynomial time algorithm for a special case of unsigned permutations. The best known approximation algorithm for MIN-SBR, due to Christie, gives a performance ratio of 1.5. In this paper, by exploiting the polynomial time algorithm for sorting signed permutations and by developing a new approximation algorithm for maximum cycle decomposition of breakpoint graphs, we design a new 1.375-algorithm for the MIN-SBR problem.",
